# Arduino_Uno_Temp-Humidity-and-LED-Indicator
Playing around with sensor data using the Arduino Uno

This is initial testing. Future improvements might include:
- Switching board to the Arduino MKR Wifi 1010.
- Implement database connectivity.
  - Hopefully using a Raspberry Pi 4 as server, using MariaDB.
- Build a nice plastic case for it to be used outside.
